üîß **Core Strategies**
1. Uniform Grid Strategy
Creates systematic grid-based sprinkler placement:

  Calculates room bounding box,<br/>
  Places sprinklers at regular intervals in an uniform grid pattern (2500mm spacing),<br/>
  Maintains wall clearances<br/>

2. Optimized Coverage Strategy
Uses geometric analysis for maximum coverage:<br/>

Start<br/>
  ‚Üì<br/>
compute centroid -> if valid add to sprinklers<br/>
  ‚Üì<br/>
while iteration < maxIterations:<br/>
  FindNextOptimalPosition:<br/>
    - grid scan over (x,y)<br/>
    - skip if outside or too near walls<br/>
    - skip if too close to other sprinklers<br/>
    - score candidate by sampling uncovered points<br/>
  if best candidate is null -> break<br/>
  else add sprinkler and continue<br/>
  ‚Üì<br/>
return sprinklers<br/>

3. Pipe Proximity Strategy
Minimizes connection distances to existing pipes:<br/>

  -sampling points along each pipe (projected to the ceiling),<br/>
  -filtering those points to stay inside the room and respect wall clearance,<br/>
  -sorting the candidate points by how close they are to pipes (closest first),<br/>
  -greedily adding candidates while enforcing minimum spacing between sprinklers.<br/>
