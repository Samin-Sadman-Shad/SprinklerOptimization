üîß **Core Strategies**
1. Uniform Grid Strategy
Creates systematic grid-based sprinkler placement:

  Calculates room bounding box,
  Places sprinklers at regular intervals in an uniform grid pattern (2500mm spacing),
  Maintains wall clearances,

2. Optimized Coverage Strategy
Uses geometric analysis for maximum coverage:

Start
  ‚Üì
compute centroid -> if valid add to sprinklers
  ‚Üì
while iteration < maxIterations:
  FindNextOptimalPosition:
    - grid scan over (x,y)
    - skip if outside or too near walls
    - skip if too close to other sprinklers
    - score candidate by sampling uncovered points
  if best candidate is null -> break
  else add sprinkler and continue
  ‚Üì
return sprinklers

3. Pipe Proximity Strategy
Minimizes connection distances to existing pipes:

  -sampling points along each pipe (projected to the ceiling),
  -filtering those points to stay inside the room and respect wall clearance,
  -sorting the candidate points by how close they are to pipes (closest first),
  -greedily adding candidates while enforcing minimum spacing between sprinklers.
